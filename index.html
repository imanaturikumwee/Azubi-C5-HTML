    <strong>Meat</strong> is animal flesh that is eaten as food.Humans have hunted, farmed, and scavenged other animals for meat since prehistoric times. The establishment of settlements <br>
    in the Neolithic Revolution allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs, and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat production <br>

  <p>Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. It is edible raw but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. <br>
     Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with, and decomposition by, bacteria and fungi.
